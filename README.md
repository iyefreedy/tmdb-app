# React TMDB

This project aims to create a movies database application utilizing The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The TMDB API provides a wealth of information about movies, including details such as titles, release dates, ratings, cast, crew, and more. By leveraging this API, users can access a vast repository of movie data and interact with it through a user-friendly interface.
